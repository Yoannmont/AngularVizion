    "Desc_content": "AngularVizion is a web application for image recognition developed with Angular, PyTorch, and Flask. The aim of this simple project is to train in the simultaneous use of several popular tech tools. The application allows users to upload images and uses Facebook's DETR-RESNET-50 model to recognize objects in these images.",
